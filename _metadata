  "description" : "[[WARNING]] This mod is in early/active development and could change. Use at your own risk and be sure to back up your savegames!\n\n\nVesselbound allows objects and liquids to be sent and sorted over wires. \nIt's a general purpose set of wiring objects and systems that can be used to automate sortiing, create elaborate automations, dungeons. \nIt's also been built with other mods in mind, and has an internal API for handling wired objects/liquids.\n\n\nPresently it gives you several new items that can be built from the mechanics (or \"gear\") tab of the wiring station.\nThese are:\n\nSinks: These act like a drain except they send items the suck up down wires. They can also be used to spit out items/liquids\n\nFilters: These restrict items that are sent down a wire. \n- Race filter: will only pass on an object that matches it's selected race. Use the filter to switch race\n- Type filter: will only pass on an object that matches the item type of the filter. Use the filter to switch it's item type\n- Category filter: will only pass on objects that have the same category as an object placed in the filter\n- Exact filter: will only pass on objects if one of those objects has been placed in the filter\nRepeaters: These just pass anything along. They're useful for prioritizing or just cleaning up your wiring. \n\nInbox: A simple container that can have items wired to/from it \n\nContainer Link: An object that links to the the nearest container (within a short distance). Allowing that container to be used as an inbox.\n\n\nSee the following videos for examples of it's use: \n\nSinks: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXiASJpTCbs\nAutomatic item sorting using filters: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NghpLXKcUOM\n\nVesselbound is an open source project. \nTo report bugs or contribute to it's development head over to https://github.com/Cratesmith/VesselBound",
